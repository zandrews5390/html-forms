            <p>Each section below asks you to practice coding HTML form widgets. Be sure to use the comments in each section to help you to complete the work. You can refer back to your zyBook, or to the examples in Canvas.</p>

            <section id="form">
                <h2>Form Code</h2>
                <p>Scroll within the container below to see all of the code needed to wrap your form widgets and labels.</p>

                    <code>
<!--                 -->&lt;form action="https://wp.zybooks.com/form-viewer.php" method="POST" target="_blank"&gt;

            <section id="labels">
                <h2>Form Labels</h2>
                <p>All form inputs and widgets require a properly coded label element. The text between the label tags should tell the user the type of expected input and whether or not it is required. The label's <code>for</code> attribute should be set to the same value as the input's ID.</p>
                <p>Please fill out and submit the form below. Required inputs are marked with an <span class="required">*</span></p>

                <!-- TO DO: Add a form here with the correct action and method attributes, then add a single input for a full name that is required for submission. Be sure to include a properly associated label to this form. You will also need to add a control to allow the user to submit the form. The label should say: "Please Enter Your Full Name: *" and the text on the control to submit should say "Submit Form" -->

                <h2>Text &amp; Number Input</h2>
                <p>Text inputs are probably the type that you will see most often on the web. While they can accept input with letters, numbers, and punctuation, they won't always be the correct/semantic type for your expected input. For our user age input below, we'll make the input type number. While we could use a text input, age should only include a number in years, so a number input would be more appropriate.</p>

                <p>Telephone numbers and email addresses can be a pain to type out on the internet. Using the correct input type makes it easier for your users wo autocomplete your forms and it means that a more helpful keyboard will display when they click on an input to fill it out.</p>

                <p>Radio buttons and check boxes are used a lot in forms. A set of radio buttons gives you options from which you can only choose one.

                <p>To see the actual value of the radio sent to the server along with its name when the user makes a choice, include a "value" property and set it to text that aligns with the label.</p>
